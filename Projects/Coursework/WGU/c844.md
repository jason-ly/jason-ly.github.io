# C844 Task 1: Network Vulnerability and Risk Assessment

## Project Overview
This project for my class at Western Governor's University involved performing a comprehensive network vulnerability and risk assessment using industry-standard tools such as **Nmap**, **Zenmap**, and **Wireshark**. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, assess their implications, and propose effective remediation strategies to enhance network security.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Nmap & Zenmap:** For network scanning and topology analysis.
- **Wireshark:** For packet capture and analysis.
- **Windows Server & Linux Systems:** As part of the simulated network environment.

## Vulnerability Scans Using Nmap

### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **Open Port TCP/22 (CVE-2016-0778):**  
   - Implication: Could allow denial of service through resource exhaustion.  
   - **Solution:** Update to OpenSSH 7.1p2 and implement IP-based restrictions.

2. **Open Port TCP/21 (FileZilla FTP):**  
   - Implication: Unencrypted FTP traffic exposes sensitive credentials.  
   - **Solution:** Replace FTP with SFTP or FTPS and enable logging and monitoring.

3. **Outdated Microsoft Windows Server 2008:**  
   - Implication: Unsupported OS with no security updates leaves the system vulnerable to malware.  
   - **Solution:** Upgrade to a supported version or migrate to Azure for security updates.

## Packet Analysis Using WireShark

### Anomalies Detected:

1. **Plaintext FTP Credentials:** Credentials were exposed during communication.  
   - **Solution:** Switch to SFTP or FTPS and use network segmentation.

2. **SMBv1 Usage and Repeated Access Attempts:** Detected SMBv1 protocol and brute force attempts.  
   - **Solution:** Disable SMBv1 and implement stronger access controls.

3. **Plaintext HTTP Credentials:** Login credentials were transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection.  
   - **Solution:** Transition to HTTPS and implement MFA.
     
---

## Recommended Solutions
- **Protocol Upgrades:** Transition insecure protocols (FTP, HTTP, SMBv1) to secure alternatives (SFTP, HTTPS, SMBv3).
- **System Updates:** Replace unsupported systems with updated, secure versions.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate critical systems to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an extra layer of security for all user accounts.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated my ability to:
- Perform detailed vulnerability assessments.
- Analyze packet captures for anomalies.
- Propose actionable solutions to improve network security.
